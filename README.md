# Prog_Charity
Hi there! My name is Imran Iskakov. 
In this project I implemented my idea of creating a cyber-forum where everyone could find help related to programming for free.
Authorized Users could share knowledge, ask for help, and publish help offers, communicate via the built in messenger, and arrange the 101 meetings since website has 
a built in map navigator. ALso it implements some paradigms of a social networking websties as users could find each other by the nicknames and create meaningful connections.
Overall, this server would help connect teachers with students for free, thus developing and promoting the culture of mutual help. 

I used FLASK framework as a basis for my website and a bootstrap design features to make it look more appealing. The code itself is written in Python 3, while the templates
are coded in HTML5 and CSS. Since that was my very first experience in web developing, I would be grateful for any king of feedback that I could imporve on!
